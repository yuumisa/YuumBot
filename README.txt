Yuumisa's outdated music bot, initially none as YuumBot 1.4.

My first attempt at making a music bot utilizing ffmpeg to download and encode youtube audio, 
and a python library called youtubesearchypthon to parse through a given youtube playlist 
and then manually input the titles of each song back into the youtube search function.


Currently the bot is operational and will output audio correctly, however, 
the queue system is buggy, the audio quality is not very good, and overall the program is slow at what it does.
